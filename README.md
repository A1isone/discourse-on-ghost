> Add Ghost-based SSO to Discourse

Discourse is a powerful forum and commenting platform. Ghost is a powerful publishing platform. _Discourse on Ghost_ marries the platforms to create a more cohesive membership experience.

- Use Ghost as the SSO (Single Sign On) Provider for Discourse, so Ghost serves as your central member repository
- Segment and Lock user discussions based on Ghost Membership tiers
